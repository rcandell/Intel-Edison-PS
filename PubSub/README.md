App Overview
------------

This blank template creates a project folder that contains the minimum files
needed for an Intel XDK Node.js IoT app. The development process assumes that
your target device is running a compatible version of
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and is accessible to the Intel XDK via a network
connection.
