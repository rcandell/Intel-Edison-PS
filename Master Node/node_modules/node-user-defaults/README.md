# User Defaults

Persistent data store for node apps.

### Getting Started

The goal of this library is to provide a very straighforward way to write persistent data to disk. This can be useful when working with small amounts of data, like a simple configuration of an application or to store some preferences of a user. All data is stored in JSON format.

```sh
# Add the lib to your project and you are good to go.
$ yarn add node-user-defaults

# Not in a hurry? Use npm.
$ npm install --save node-user-defaults
```

#### Sample Code

```js
import Store from 'node-user-defaults';

// OPTIONAL: Choose an output location for the JSON file.
// If this one is not provided, a random one will be created.
// You can always check the location via Store.getLocation().
Store.setLocation('~/.app-name');

// Storing variables is very easy and straighforward.
// You can store any type that is supported by JSON.
Store.write('darkTheme', true);

// Reading data is easy too. It's also possible to provide
// a default value in case the variable is not in the store.
const darkTheme = Store.read('darkTheme');
const name = Store.read('name', 'defaultValue');

// You can also write multiple variables at once by storing
// a plan JSON object. Easy huh?
Store.writeJson({ name: 'John' });

// It is also possible to overwrite the whole configuration.
// So all previously stored variables will be removed.
Store.writeJson({ name: 'John' }, true);

// Last but not least, you can query all the variables at once.
const data = Store.defaults();
```
